# Data Privacy and Security Policy


## 1. Introduction

This Data Privacy and Security Policy outlines the comprehensive measures and principles governing the collection, storage, processing, and protection of user data within the Money Tracker Progressive Web Application (PWA). In an application dealing with sensitive financial information, data privacy and security are paramount. Our commitment is to ensure the highest standards of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for all user data, fostering trust and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

Given the potential for age-based users (children/teens) as highlighted in the project requirements, this policy places particular emphasis on enhanced safeguards for minors, including robust consent mechanisms where applicable. We understand that financial data is deeply personal, and any breach or misuse can have significant consequences. Therefore, this document details our approach to data handling, security architecture, compliance frameworks, and user rights, providing transparency and accountability.

This policy serves as a foundational document for all development, operational, and legal aspects of the Money Tracker PWA. All stakeholders, including developers, administrators, and third-party service providers, must adhere strictly to the guidelines and protocols outlined herein. Our objective is not only to meet regulatory requirements but to exceed industry best practices in protecting our users' financial well-being and privacy.



## 2. Data Collection and Usage

The Money Tracker PWA collects only the data necessary to provide its services, enhance user experience, and ensure the security and integrity of the application. All data collection is performed with transparency and with the user's informed consent.

### 2.1. Types of Data Collected

We collect the following categories of data:

*   **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):**
    *   **Contact Information:** Email address (for account creation, communication, and password recovery).
    *   **Demographic Information:** Age range, country of residence (collected during onboarding for personalization, but optional).
*   **Financial Data:**
    *   **Account Information:** Bank names, account types (checking, savings, credit card, investment), and masked account numbers (e.g., last four digits) for display purposes. Full account numbers are never stored directly by the PWA.
    *   **Transaction Data:** Date, description, amount, category, and associated account for each transaction. This data is imported from linked financial institutions or manually entered by the user.
    *   **Balance Data:** Current and historical balances for linked accounts.
    *   **Financial Goals:** User-defined goals (e.g., savings targets, debt repayment plans) and their progress.
    *   **Budget Information:** User-defined budget categories and limits.
*   **Usage Data:**
    *   **Application Usage:** Information about how users interact with the PWA, including features accessed, time spent, and navigation paths. This helps in improving the app's usability and performance.
    *   **Device Information:** Device type, operating system, and browser type for optimizing compatibility and troubleshooting.
    *   **IP Address:** For security purposes, fraud prevention, and general geographic location inference.
*   **Communication Data:** Records of communications with user support.

### 2.2. Sources of Data Collection

Data is collected from the following sources:

*   **Directly from User:** Information provided during registration, profile setup, manual transaction entry, budget creation, goal setting, and communication with support.
*   **Financial Data Aggregators:** Through secure integrations with third-party services like Plaid, Yodlee, or Finicity, with explicit user consent, to import account and transaction data from linked financial institutions.
*   **Automated Collection:** Through cookies, analytics tools, and server logs to gather usage and device information.

### 2.3. Purpose of Data Usage

We use the collected data for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain Services:** To enable core functionalities of the Money Tracker PWA, including transaction tracking, budgeting, goal management, and financial reporting.
*   **Personalization:** To tailor the user experience, provide personalized insights, recommendations, and relevant financial advice based on user profiles and financial behavior.

*   **Security and Fraud Prevention:** To protect user accounts, detect and prevent fraudulent activities, and ensure the integrity of our systems.
*   **Communication:** To send important service-related notifications, updates, and respond to user inquiries. Marketing communications are only sent with explicit consent.
*   **Compliance:** To comply with legal obligations and regulatory requirements.

We do not sell user data to third parties. Any sharing of data with third-party service providers is strictly for the purpose of delivering the Money Tracker PWA's services and is governed by stringent data processing agreements.



## 3. Data Storage and Security

Protecting user data is our highest priority. We implement robust technical and organizational measures to safeguard data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our security practices are designed to meet or exceed industry standards.

### 3.1. Data Storage Locations

User data is stored on secure servers located within reputable cloud data centers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). These data centers employ advanced physical and environmental security controls. The specific geographic location of data storage may vary based on user region (e.g., US users data in US data centers, EU users data in EU data centers) to comply with data residency requirements.

### 3.2. Encryption

*   **Encryption at Rest:** All sensitive user data, including financial data and PII, is encrypted when stored on our servers using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256). Database encryption, file system encryption, and full disk encryption are employed.
*   **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted between the user's device and our servers, and between our servers and third-party service providers (e.g., financial data aggregators), is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2 or higher) to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

### 3.3. Access Control

Access to user data is strictly limited to authorized personnel who require it to perform their job functions. We implement:

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access permissions are granted based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring employees only have access to the data necessary for their specific roles.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA is required for all internal systems accessing sensitive data.
*   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforced for all internal accounts.
*   **Regular Access Reviews:** Access logs are regularly reviewed and audited to detect and prevent unauthorized access.

### 3.4. Network Security

Our network infrastructure is protected by:

*   **Firewalls:** To control inbound and outbound network traffic.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** To monitor for and respond to malicious activities.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Regular assessments are conducted by independent third parties to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.

### 3.5. Data Minimization and Retention

*   **Data Minimization:** We collect only the data that is necessary for the stated purposes. We do not collect or retain data that is not directly relevant to providing our services or meeting legal obligations.
*   **Data Retention:** User data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to provide the services, and to comply with legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Upon account deletion, data is securely anonymized or purged in accordance with our data retention policy.

### 3.6. Incident Response Plan

We have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to address potential data breaches or security incidents. This plan includes procedures for:

*   Detection and containment of incidents.
*   Investigation and root cause analysis.
*   Notification to affected users and regulatory authorities (where required by law).
*   Remediation and post-incident review.

### 3.7. Special Considerations for Age-Based Users (Children/Teens)

Recognizing that the app may be used by children or teens, we implement additional safeguards:

*   **Parental Consent:** For users identified as minors (e.g., under 13 or as defined by local regulations like COPPA), parental consent mechanisms will be implemented before collecting any personal information. This may involve verifiable parental consent processes.
*   **Limited Data Collection:** For minors, data collection will be further limited to only what is strictly necessary for the educational and financial literacy features of the app.
*   **Age Gating:** Mechanisms to identify and restrict access for users below a certain age or to route them through specific consent flows.
*   **Educational Focus:** Features for minors will prioritize financial literacy education and safe money management practices, avoiding any features that might encourage risky financial behavior.

These measures collectively ensure a secure environment for all users, with heightened protection for younger individuals, aligning with our commitment to responsible data stewardship.



## 4. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing
