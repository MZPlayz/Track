# Testing Strategy and QA Checklist


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance (QA) Checklist for the Money Tracker Progressive Web Application (PWA). A robust testing approach is critical to ensure the application's reliability, performance, security, and user experience, especially given its role in managing sensitive financial data. This strategy aims to identify and rectify defects early in the development lifecycle, ensuring that the delivered product meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

The testing process will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, from unit testing by developers to comprehensive system and user acceptance testing. Emphasis will be placed on automated testing where feasible, complemented by manual testing for critical user journeys and exploratory testing. The ultimate goal is to deliver a high-quality, stable, and secure application that users can trust for their personal financial management needs.

This document serves as a guide for all team members involved in the development and quality assurance of the Money Tracker PWA, ensuring a consistent and thorough approach to testing. It will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the application, technology stack, and testing best practices.



## 2. Testing Phases and Types

The testing strategy for the Money Tracker PWA will encompass various phases and types of testing, each designed to address specific quality attributes and defect categories.

### 2.1. Unit Testing

*   **Purpose:** To verify the correctness of individual components or modules in isolation.
*   **Scope:** Frontend components (React components, utility functions), Backend API endpoints, database models, and business logic functions.
*   **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library (for frontend), Pytest (for backend).
*   **Responsibility:** Developers.
*   **Frequency:** Continuously during development, before code commits.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

*   **Purpose:** To verify the interactions between different modules or services.
*   **Scope:** Frontend-backend API calls, database interactions, third-party API integrations (e.g., Plaid), and module-to-module communication.
*   **Tools:** Pytest (for backend API integration), Cypress (for frontend-backend integration).
*   **Responsibility:** Developers and QA Engineers.
*   **Frequency:** After unit testing, as part of CI/CD pipeline.

### 2.3. UI Testing (End-to-End Testing)

*   **Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios and verify the entire application flow from end to end.
*   **Scope:** Critical user journeys (onboarding, transaction entry, budget creation, goal tracking, report generation).
*   **Tools:** Cypress (preferred for PWA, mobile-first focus), Playwright.
*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers.
*   **Frequency:** Per sprint, before major releases.

### 2.4. Performance Testing

*   **Purpose:** To assess the application's responsiveness, stability, scalability, and resource usage under various load conditions.

*   **Tools:** Axe DevTools, Lighthouse, manual testing with screen readers.
*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, Developers.
*   **Frequency:** Per sprint, before major releases.

### 2.9. Regression Testing

*   **Purpose:** To ensure that new code changes do not negatively impact existing functionalities.
*   **Scope:** All critical and frequently used features.
*   **Tools:** Automated test suites (unit, integration, UI tests).
*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers.
*   **Frequency:** Continuously, as part of CI/CD pipeline, before every release.
