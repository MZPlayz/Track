### 3.1 Directory Explanations

**App Directory (`app/`):** Contains all route definitions using Next.js App Router. Each directory represents a route, with special files like `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, and `error.tsx` providing route-specific functionality.

**Components Directory (`components/`):** Houses all reusable components organized by category. The `ui/` subdirectory contains ShadCN/UI components, while other subdirectories contain application-specific components.

**Hooks Directory (`hooks/`):** Contains custom React hooks that encapsulate business logic and state management. These hooks provide clean interfaces for components to interact with application data and functionality.

**Lib Directory (`lib/`):** Contains utility functions, configuration files, and shared logic that doesn't fit into other categories. This includes API client setup, authentication helpers, and validation schemas.

**Types Directory (`types/`):** Centralizes TypeScript type definitions for better maintainability and reusability across the application.

## 4. Component Architecture

### 4.1 Component Hierarchy

The component architecture follows a hierarchical structure that promotes reusability and maintainability while ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

**Layout Components** provide the structural foundation for the application, including headers, navigation, and page containers. These components remain consistent across different routes while accommodating route-specific content.

**Page Components** represent complete views that users navigate to, such as the dashboard, transaction list, or budget management pages. These components orchestrate multiple smaller components and manage page-level state.

**Feature Components** encapsulate specific functionality related to financial management, such as transaction forms, budget displays, or goal tracking widgets. These components are reusable across different pages but contain domain-specific logic.

**UI Components** provide the basic building blocks for the interface, including buttons, inputs, cards, and other fundamental elements. These components are highly reusable and contain minimal business logic.

### 4.2 ShadCN/UI Integration Patterns

**Component Customization:** ShadCN/UI components are customized through Tailwind CSS classes and variant props. The customization approach maintains the accessibility and behavior benefits of Radix UI while adapting visual appearance to match the Money Tracker design system.

**Composition Patterns:** Complex components are built by composing simpler ShadCN/UI components together. For example, a transaction item might combine Card, Button, and Badge components with custom layout and styling.

**Theme Integration:** The application uses CSS custom properties to define theme colors and spacing that integrate seamlessly with ShadCN/UI's theming system. This approach enables consistent styling while maintaining the flexibility to customize individual components.

**Accessibility Inheritance:** By building on ShadCN/UI components, the application automatically inherits robust accessibility features including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus management.

### 4.3 State Management Strategy

**Local State:** Component-level state is managed using React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks for simple state management needs. This approach keeps state close to where it's used and minimizes complexity.

**Server State:** Financial data from APIs is managed using React Query, which provides caching, synchronization, and optimistic updates. This approach ensures data consistency while providing excellent user experience through background updates.

**Global State:** Application-wide state such as user authentication and theme preferences is managed through React Context or a lightweight state management solution like Zustand. The global state is kept minimal to avoid unnecessary complexity.

**Form State:** Form data is managed using React Hook Form, which provides efficient form handling with minimal re-renders and built-in validation support.

## 5. Data Flow Architecture

### 5.1 API Integration

**API Client:** A centralized API client built with Axios or the native fetch API handles all server communication. The client includes request/response interceptors for authentication, error handling, and data transformation.

**React Query Integration:** All API calls are wrapped with React Query hooks that provide caching, background updates, and optimistic mutations. This approach ensures data consistency while providing excellent user experience.

**Type Safety:** API responses are typed using TypeScript interfaces that match the backend API specifications. Zod schemas validate runtime data to ensure type safety throughout the application.

**Error Handling:** A comprehensive error handling strategy includes both global error boundaries and specific error handling for API calls. Users receive appropriate feedback for different error types while maintaining application stability.

### 5.2 Real-time Updates

**Polling Strategy:** For financial data that requires regular updates, React Query's polling capabilities provide automatic background refreshes at appropriate intervals.

**Optimistic Updates:** User actions like adding transactions or updating budgets use optimistic updates to provide immediate feedback while the server processes the request.

**Cache Invalidation:** Strategic cache invalidation ensures data consistency when related information changes. For example, adding a transaction invalidates both transaction lists and budget calculations.

## 6. Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

**Route-based Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code at the route level, ensuring users only download JavaScript necessary for their current page.

**Component-level Splitting:** Large components like charts and complex forms are lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size and improve loading performance.

**Dynamic Imports:** Heavy libraries like chart components are loaded dynamically when needed, reducing the initial application bundle size.

### 6.2 Rendering Optimization

**React Optimization:** Components use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately to prevent unnecessary re-renders, particularly important for financial data displays that update frequently.

**Virtual Scrolling:** Large lists of transactions or historical data use virtual scrolling to maintain performance regardless of data volume.

**Image Optimization:** Next.js Image component provides automatic optimization for any images used in the application, including proper sizing and format selection.

### 6.3 Caching Strategy

**React Query Caching:** Aggressive caching of financial data with appropriate stale times ensures fast navigation while maintaining data accuracy.

**Browser Caching:** Static assets are cached appropriately using Next.js built-in optimizations and service worker caching for PWA functionality.

**Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of subscriptions, timers, and event listeners prevents memory leaks during extended application use.

## 7. PWA Implementation

### 7.1 Service Worker Strategy

**Workbox Integration:** Next.js PWA plugin with Workbox provides robust service worker functionality including caching strategies and offline support.

**Cache-First Strategy:** Static assets use cache-first strategy for optimal performance, while dynamic content uses network-first with fallback to cache.

**Background Sync:** Critical user actions like adding transactions are queued for background sync when offline, ensuring no data loss.

### 7.2 Offline Functionality

**Offline Detection:** The application detects online/offline status and provides appropriate user feedback and functionality limitations.

**Local Storage:** Critical data is stored locally using IndexedDB for offline access, with synchronization occurring when connectivity returns.

**Offline UI:** The interface adapts to offline mode with clear indicators and disabled functionality that requires server connectivity.

### 7.3 Installation and App-like Experience

**Install Prompts:** Strategic installation prompts appear when users demonstrate engagement with the application.

**App Shell:** The application shell loads immediately and provides native app-like navigation and interaction patterns.
