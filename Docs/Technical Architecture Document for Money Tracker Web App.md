# Technical Architecture Document for Money Tracker Web App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture for the Money Tracker Web App, detailing the system's structure, components, technologies, and deployment considerations. The aim is to provide a clear blueprint for the development team, ensuring a scalable, secure, and maintainable application.

## 2. Overall Architecture

The Money Tracker Web App will adopt a **Client-Server Architecture** with a clear separation between the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). This approach facilitates independent development, scalability, and flexibility in technology choices. Communication between the client and server will primarily occur via RESTful APIs.

### 2.2. Component Breakdown

*   **Frontend Web App:** The user-facing application responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and making API calls to the backend. It will be built as a Single Page Application (SPA).
*   **Backend API:** The central server-side component that handles business logic, data processing, authentication, authorization, and communication with the database and external services.
*   **Database:** Stores all application data, including user profiles, transactions, budgets, goals, and account information.
*   **Financial Data Aggregator:** A third-party service responsible for securely connecting to users' bank accounts and importing transaction data. This component handles the complexities of financial institution integrations and data standardization.
*   **Notification Service:** Responsible for sending various notifications to users (e.g., in-app, push notifications) based on events triggered by the backend.

## 3. Technology Stack

### 3.1. Frontend
*   **Framework:** React.js (or Vue.js/Angular) for building interactive UIs. Chosen for its component-based structure, large community, and strong ecosystem.
*   **State Management:** Redux (or Zustand/Context API) for managing application state, especially for complex data flows.
*   **Routing:** React Router (or Vue Router/Angular Router) for client-side navigation.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Styled Components for efficient and maintainable styling, promoting consistency and responsiveness.
*   **Charting Library:** Chart.js or Recharts for dynamic and engaging data visualizations (income/expense charts, progress charts).
*   **Build Tool:** Webpack or Vite for bundling and optimizing frontend assets.

### 3.2. Backend
*   **Language:** Python. Chosen for its readability, extensive libraries, and suitability for rapid development and data processing.
*   **Web Framework:** Flask (or FastAPI/Django). Flask is lightweight and flexible, suitable for building RESTful APIs. FastAPI offers high performance and automatic API documentation. Django is a full-featured framework for larger applications.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL. A powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, data integrity, and advanced features. Suitable for structured financial data.
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** SQLAlchemy. Provides a flexible and powerful way to interact with the database using Python objects, abstracting SQL queries.
*   **API Design:** RESTful API principles will be followed, using JSON for data exchange.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication, combined with OAuth 2.0 for secure delegation of access to financial data aggregators.

### 3.3. External Services & Integrations
*   **Financial Data Aggregation:** Plaid (or Yodlee/Finicity). These services provide secure APIs for linking bank accounts, retrieving transaction data, and verifying account ownership. They handle the complexities of connecting to various financial institutions.
*   **Notification Push Service:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or similar for push notifications to mobile devices.

### 3.4. Infrastructure & Deployment
*   **Containerization:** Docker. For packaging the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
*   **Orchestration (Future):** Kubernetes. For automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, enabling high availability and fault tolerance.
*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure. For hosting the application, database, and other services. Chosen for their scalability, reliability, and comprehensive suite of services.
    *   **Compute:** AWS EC2/ECS, GCP Compute Engine/Cloud Run, Azure Virtual Machines/App Service.
    *   **Database Service:** AWS RDS (PostgreSQL), GCP Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
    *   **Storage:** AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage for static assets and backups.
*   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins. For automating the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.

## 4. Data Model (High-Level)

The core data entities will include:
*   **Users:** Stores user profiles, authentication details.
*   **Accounts:** Stores details of linked financial accounts (bank, credit card, investment).
*   **Transactions:** Stores individual income and expense records, linked to accounts and categories.
*   **Categories:** Stores user-defined and system-defined transaction categories.
*   **Budgets:** Stores budget configurations and limits for categories over specific periods.
*   **Goals:** Stores financial goals (e.g., savings, debt repayment) with target amounts and progress.

*(Detailed database schema will be provided in a separate document.)*

## 5. Security Considerations

Security is paramount for a financial application. Key considerations include:
*   **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data (user credentials, financial data) will be encrypted at rest (database encryption) and in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (MFA) and granular authorization to ensure users only access their own data.
*   **Input Validation:** Strict input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
*   **API Security:** Implement rate limiting, API key management, and secure API gateway practices.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
*   **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and financial industry best practices.

## 6. Scalability and Reliability

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Design the backend to allow for horizontal scaling of API instances to handle increased user load.
*   **Database Scalability:** Utilize managed database services with read replicas and sharding capabilities (if needed).
*   **Load Balancing:** Implement load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring for application performance, errors, and infrastructure health, with automated alerting.
*   **Backup & Recovery:** Establish robust data backup and disaster recovery procedures.

This technical architecture provides a solid foundation for building a robust, scalable, and secure Money Tracker Web App. Specific implementation details will be further elaborated in subsequent design documents.
